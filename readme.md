Absolutely! Here’s a detailed answer to each part of your request:

---

### 1. **Tech Stack Recommendation**

**Python** is a great choice for your requirements. Here’s a modern, scalable stack:

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python, async, modular, scalable)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python, easy for rapid prototyping) or React (JS, for more customization)
- **Database:** Yes, you’ll need one (see below)
- **Search/Chat:** Use a retrieval-augmented approach (vector search + LLM, e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, or local models)

### 2. **Project Structure for Scalability & Extensibility**

Organize your codebase into clear modules. Example structure:

```
study-notes-chat/
│
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py           # FastAPI app entrypoint
│   ├── db.py             # Database connection & models
│   ├── notes.py          # Notes CRUD and search logic
│   ├── chat.py           # Chat logic (retrieval, LLM integration)
│   └── ...
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── streamlit_app.py  # If using Streamlit
│   └── (react-app/)      # If using React
│
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- **Each feature** (notes, chat, user management, etc.) gets its own module.
- **Easy to add new features** by creating new modules.

### 3. **Do You Need a Database?**

**Yes.**  
A database is essential for scalability, efficient search, and future features (like user accounts, analytics, etc.).

#### **Recommended Options:**
- **SQLite:** Simple, file-based, great for prototyping or small projects.
- **PostgreSQL:** Robust, scalable, open-source, ideal for production.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL, flexible schema, good for unstructured notes.
- **Vector DB (for semantic search):** ChromaDB, Weaviate, or FAISS (for advanced search features).

### 4. **Suggested Website Names**

- **NoteWise**
- **QueryNotes**
- **StudySage**
- **ScholarChat**
- **NoteBot**
- **InsightNotes**
- **AskMyNotes**
- **NoteGenius**

### 5. **Next Steps**

Would you like a starter template (FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend + SQLite DB) to get you going?  
Or do you want to discuss the chat/search logic in more detail first?
